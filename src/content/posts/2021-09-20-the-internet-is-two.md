# Note

This article does not provide a book definition of the Internet, but more of a real-world, not so precise easily understandable definition.

The Internet is, without a doubt, the greatest invention of humankind. It brings thousands, millions of people together. For free, at any place and time. It spread information and knowledge as well as entertainment, allowing for unlimited learning and sharing of information. This information sharing has allowed for the fastest development humankind has seen in all its history.

How does the Internet work? How does it do what it does? This concept is usually the first thing I explain to my students in my networking class. And I usually start the explanation by saying that there is not only one Internet but two.

# Internet 1

![Router to router](/assets/world-internet.jpg "The information jumps from router to router.")

Everyone has a router at home. This router is a device that redirects data to somewhere else. It usually goes first to another router in your building, then to another in your block, and so on.

When we think about an internet connection, we think about connecting two devices. Take your smartphone as an example. When it sends data to someone else's smartphone, the data goes through WiFi to your router and then to another router and another until it reaches the other smartphone. The network that allows doing this is the first Internetâ€”networks connected to other networks and protocols to redirect the messages. Usually, there is more than one possibility to forward a message. So if a particular link is lost, the communication can continue.

If we look at the origins of the Internet, it was designed to resist attacks against single facilities. Its primary objective was to decentralize the available information. The routers used nowadays to forward the traffic belong to Internet Service Providers and specialized companies which business core is to forward traffic. 

In my opinion, the most significant beauty that this Internet has is that it is not restricted to a single technology. We have devices connected through wire, cellular networks, satellites, etc. It is scalable and configurable. Probably the greatest system developed by humankind. Simply amazing.

# Internet 2

![Servers](/assets/server_internet.jpg "A nice picture of the cloud.")

Nevertheless, to establish a connection, we need a minimum of two users, one at each end. On one end, we have our device, our computer, smartphone, or tablet. But what is at the other end? It depends on who is on the other end.

If we have a P2P connection, we are directly connected to another user. We will talk more about this type of connection in another post.

The most common type of connection is a client-server connection. A server is a computer that _serves_. It receives requests and replies - or serves - an answer. Each time we connect to a web page, our web browser asks for content. The server then replies with some files that your browser can read to display the webpage. 

At the early stages of the Internet, the pages were very basic. The servers, not very powerful, could only serve small web pages to a handful of users.

Now the servers are extremely powerful. Not only can they serve millions of pages every day, but they can also perform complex computations and serve unique personalized pages. Moreover, now more data could be transmitted than simple web pages, like gaming data in real-time, music, audio, emails, video, or virtual reality content. 

For example, each time you enter Youtube, it shows you a unique selection of videos designed to maximize your time watching videos. And when you enter into Amazon, the server can know who you are and show the most exciting products for you.

These servers are everywhere. There was a time not so long ago when I had my server at my place. I used a Raspberry Pi for this, one of the most miniature computers.

The majority of web pages are located in a shared server. The webpage is _hosted_ together with thousands of others. Hosting companies sell space on servers specialized in hosting this type of content.

Companies like Google or Amazon own huge buildings that contain their servers. They spend millions every week maintaining all their infrastructure. It only belongs to them. But they are not the only ones using it. Amazon, for example, sells the computing power of their servers. It is called Amazon Web Service, or AWS.

All the server infrastructure is what I consider the second Internet. Yes, technically, it is NOT the Internet but is a crucial part of it. And oh, by the way, have you heard of that thing called _The Cloud_? There is no such thing as a cloud; everything is computed in a server somewhere. It occupies real physical space, and it is really located somewhere in the world.

# Conclusion

I lied at the beginning. The Internet is the Internet, and the servers are the servers. But we could not think about the Internet without all the functionality that servers provide. In the future, we will see other architectures a little bit more esoteric. Maybe in the future, the Internet will be thousands!
