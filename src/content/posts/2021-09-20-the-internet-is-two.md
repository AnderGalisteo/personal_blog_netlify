# Note

This article does not provide a book definition of Internet, but more of a real world not so precise easily undestandable definition.

The internet is, whitout a doubt, the greatest invention of humankind. It brings thousands, millions of people together. For free, at any place and time. It spread information and knowledge as well as entertainment, allowing for unlimited learning and sharing of information. This information sharing has allowed to the fastest development humankind has seen in all its history.

How does internet work? How does it do what it does? This is usually the first thing I explain to my students in my networking class. And I usually start the explanation by saying that there is not only one internet but two.

# Internet 1

Everyone has a router at home. This router is a device that allows data to be redirected to somewhere else. It usually goes first to another router in your building, then to another in your block and so on and so forth.

When we think about an internet connection, we think about connecting two devices. Take you smartphone as an example. When it connects to someone else's smartphone, the data goes through WiFi to your router and then to another router and to another until it reaches the other smartphone. The network that allows to do this is what I call the first internet. Networks connected to other networks and and protocols to redirect the messages. In fact, usually there is more than one possible way for a message to be redirected, so if a particular link is lost, the communication can still continue.

If we look at the origins of the internet, it was designed to be able to resist attack to single facilities, as its main objective was to decentralize the available information. The routers used nowadays to forward the trafic belong to Internet Service Providers and specialized companies which business core is to forward traffic. 

In my opinion, the biggest beauty that this internet has is that it allows to multiple technologies to be used. We have devices connected through wire, cellular networks, satellites, etc. It is scalable and configurable. Probably the biggest system developed by humankind. Simply amazing.

# Internet 2

Nevertheless, in order to stablish a connection we need a minimum of two users, one at each end. In one end we have our device, our computer, smartphone or tablet. But what is at the other end? It depends on who we are talking with.

If we are having a P2P connection, we are directly connected to 













In visual arts, a model sheet, also known as a character board, character sheet, character study or simply a study, is a document used to help standardize the appearance, poses, and gestures of a character in arts such as animation, comics, and video games.

Model sheets are required when [multiple artists](https://example.com) are involved in the production of an animated film, game, or comic to help maintain continuity in characters from scene to scene. In animation, one animator may only do one shot out of the several hundred that are required to complete an animated feature film. A character not drawn according to the production's standardized model is referred to as off-model.

## For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored.

Yes! In your face, Gandhi! Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree. What are their names? I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo.

1. Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg!
2. Soon enough.
3. There's no part of that sentence I didn't like!

### The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed. You will practice until you can make your bed in your sleep.

Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun? We're also Santa Claus! Soothe us with sweet lies. Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. \$9.95 a minute.

- That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing.
- We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera.
- Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk!

Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?! Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long. I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later. Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head."

Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home. Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long. Moving along… Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file!
