#Hello world!

Welcome to my blog! This is a blog about science, technology, industry, academia and everything in between. I hope you enjoy reading my blog and I hope it will inspire you to learn more about the world around you. I also hope that you will comment on my posts and tell me what you think about them. I am always interested in hearing what other people think about the things I write about. If you would like to contact me, you can email me at www.andergalisteo.com .
I'm in the middle between science (got my Ph.D at UC3m), technology (got my engineering undergrad in UNAV), market (working on my MBA on Quantic School of Business and Technology) and industry (working for Dojo Five in industrial projects).  I'm always interested in learning new things and I always like to share what I know. I like to write about science, technology, industry and anything that I think can help me and others to learn new things and to improve what we know.
So, I decided to create a blog so that I can write about what I know and what I learn.
