What you can expect from this blog:

1. Interesting technical content.
2. In deepth explanation of multiple concepts across the technical expectrum for all types of levels.
3. Personal opinions and experiences.

What you can **NOT** expect:

1. Regular content over time.
2. Only content about a single topic.
3. Not having fun!

As an engineer and a Ph.D. my areas of knowledge are both very wide and shallow and very deep and narrow. I have a lot of knowledge about a very small number of things, and a very small amount of knowledge about a very wide range of things. It’s a bit of a curse. If you ask me, “How well does a person understand a subject?” I’m going to say, “I have a degree in it, but I only really know a tiny fragment.” That’s a problem. So I have a lot of experience in small areas, but I don’t have a lot of experience in big areas.

Some of the topics I like are AI, cybersecurity and embedded systems. I'm also interested in the intersection of technology and industry. Also, I am always trying to learn new things and I am specially interested in new learning models. This is why I try to try then all!

I am going to try to post at least once a week sharing my experience with interesting things that I encounter in my daily job, the surrounding environment and the tools I am using. If you want to know more about anything, feel free to get in touch!

I wanted to end this with a quote but I didn't find one, so I decided to ask OpenAI (more specifically to its GPT-3 model) and the reply was
_"You can't wait for inspiration. You have to go after it with a club."_ - Jack London

I hope you enjoy my posts, and if you do, please feel free to share them with your friends and colleagues.
